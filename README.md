# Github Profile Explorer

This project allows the user to search for a Github profile and view its statistics and repositories, as well as accessing the links to each repository and the profile itself.
WARNING: The Github API key inside the code is set to expire around June 2023. Please replace the REACT_API_KEY variable in the UserInfo.js with your own API key if necessary.  

How to set up:

* Install the files for the project.

* Inside the terminal, enter "npm install" to install the node_modules folder.

* Once installed, use "npm run start" to run the project locally.

How to use:

* Type the username you want to search for in the input field and press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.

* You can also search for the user by directly appending "/users/..." to the url. (replace '...' with the desired username)

* The data will begin to load. Enjoy the skeleton animation until the loading finishes.

* The user card will be shown. You can go to the profile link by clicking on "View on Github" and you can visit the github page of each repository by clicking on them.

* In the case of an error, an error message will show up. Check if you've entered the username correctly. If so, refresh the page, enter the name again and try once more.
